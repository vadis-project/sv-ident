1	Social capital is often defined as consisting of trust and post materialist values on the one hand, and social networks on the other.  From an institutionalist point of view this concept is not convincing.  Norms (i.e. informal institutions) can combine with different governance modes, not only with networks.  The regional governance literature distinguishes between at least three governance modes, hierarchies, markets, and networks, each having its own advantages.  This paper examines how regional preferences for these modes are related to trust and post materialist values.  A principle component analysis of 48 social capital indicators for 74 West German regions shows that trust and post materialist values do not solely combine with networks but also with preferences for markets and hierarchies.  A cluster analysis identifies two dominant types of regional social capital.  These types are different from the well-known Italian patterns described by Robert Putnam in his seminal work.  In the period 1995- 2002, annual economic growth was on average one percent higher in regions that have combined trust with strong preferences for markets and weak political networks than in opposite regions. 
2	For measuring post materialist values thirteen variables were used altogether (table 2).  The political interest question (pmat1) is regularly asked in all three surveys.  Since the cross regional correlations among the three surveys with regard to political interest are high, only the FORSA data is included here.  The regional voter turnout (pmat2) and the percentage of divorced persons (pmat8) were taken from official statistics, the housewife quota (pmat10) from the “Nationalatlas Bundesrepublik Deutschland”, published by the “Institut für Länderkunde Leipzig” in 2004 and the Inglehardt-Index, the percentage of single-households as well as the percentage of house owners (pmat 5,9,11), from the so called “Familienatlas”, published by the “Deutsche Jugend Institut” (DJI) in 1993 and 1997.  The indicator for the number of manifestations (pmat4) is constructed on basis of a research project called “Protestereignisse in der BRD 1950- 1993”.  The data is a collection of local, regional and national manifestations that were published in the leading newspapers in Germany.  To avoid bias with regard to national manifestations mostly taking place in the capital or other central cities, we concentrated on local and regional manifestations per 1000 inhabitants in the period 1980-1993.  To increase data quality for the price of less information we categorized the data in five quintiles from little manifestations to many manifestations.  The left-right scale (pmat6) is also asked by the ALLBUS survey but with regard to lower case numbers the FORSA data was selected.  The indicator is highly correlated with the regional attitudes to the German left-wing party PDS and the right-wing party REP also available in the FORSA database.  The variable “attitude towards abortion” (pmat7) was selected from a set of four questions in the ALLBUS survey, also asking for the attitude towards homosexuality, cannabis and not paying for public transports.  All the variables are correlated. The variables “personal faith is up to me” (pmat12) and “life is controlled by others” (pmat13) were also selected from a whole battery of questions (altogether 17) with the object to find out, if people think they can determine their lives themselves.  All of the variables are again correlated. We use the recently published German social survey data (ALLBUS) for the year 2012 to perform Mincer-style quintile regressions for monthly earnings. 
3	 Six additional proxies were selected for the hierarchy preferences. 
4	The “socialism is a good idea” and the “good money for everyone” questions (hierarch3,4) are reflecting preferences for a strong (redistribution) state, but also imply the value of social equity.   The “authoritative education” and “women working” variables (hierarch5,6) are proxies for more private hierarchies. The first one is taken from the “Familienatlas”, the second one from official statistics.  A special check for data quality was possible with regard to the church attendance rate, since the same indicator is available in the SOEP, the ALLBUS and the “Familienatlas”.  The indicators from all sources are significantly correlated with the worst record for the ALLBUS data.
5	More than 22 years after the reuniﬁcation of formerly communist East Germany and democratic West Germany the difference in political and social values and the speed of convergence are subject to an ongoing debate.  Economic research offers mixed evidence.  On the one hand, Ockenfels and Weimann (1999) and Brosig et al. (2011) ﬁnd experimentally a persistent solidarity gap: East German subjects are signiﬁcantly less willing to share a windfall profit than Western German subjects even after 20 years of being united in one country.
6	ALLBUS is a biennial cross-sectional survey of the German population (precisely, all people living in Germany with sufficient German language proﬁciency). 
7	The survey uses a two-stage approach with random selection of communities and within communities random sampling of entries from the local residents’ registration oﬃce.  The focus is on attitudes, behavior and social structure. It is conducted through face-to-face interviews. The survey emphasis varies between years.  A tax morale question is only included in the 2000 and the 2002 surveys.  The investigated question is the following: “Please evaluate the following behavior: An employee makes deliberately wrong statements in his yearly income tax return and receives 500 Euro too much tax refund” (translated from the German version).   Answers are on a four point ordinal scale with one meaning “very bad” and four meaning “not bad at all”.  This tax morale question is to our knowledge not yet examined. 
8	Effect of within-country migration   The ALLBUS data includes observations of the region of birth and region of residence as well as the year of east-west or west-east migration.  This enables us to account for within-country migration and to distinguish the effect of (1) living in East Germany, (2) living and being born in East Germany, and (3) being born in East Germany and migrated to West Germany.  Further, we distinguish between east-west migration before and after the reuniﬁcation.  In the data we observe that 97% of respondents living in East Germany are also born there. In West Germany, 6.8% of respondents are born in East Germany – 3.6% have migrated before the erection of the Berlin Wall in 1961, 0.8% between 1962 and 1988 and 2.5% after 1989.  The official statistics count 2.7 million east-west migrants between 1949 and 1961 and 0.6 million between 1962 and 1988 (Hirschman 1993). 
9	Two topics are currently the subject of separate discussions in science and society: the demographic shift and the “return of the religions.“  This article appeals to data from the ALLBUS survey of 2002 to demonstrate that these two phenomena (as well as a number of other questions) can be explained if the connection between religiosity and birth-behavior is taken into account.
10	Building upon work begun in a seminar at the Religion Department of Tübingen University, the authors intend to check the observations made at the international level by Norris and Inglehart against inner-societal data for Germany and, if the postulated connection should be confirmed, to explain it with a theory based upon the material data and supported by Religious and Demographic Studies. As our source of data, we chose the ALLBUS-survey from 2002, which was conducted throughout Germany and contained questions pertaining to family as well as to religiosity, income and educational circumstances.  We shall focus on the data from respondents between the ages of 35 and 45 – a group which made substantial decisions with respect to family planning.  Of the 682 individuals in this group, 28.6% were Catholic, 29.7% Evangelical, 2.7% belonged to an independent or other Christian community, and 2.5% to a non-Christian religious community, 36.2% of the respondents were undenominational. 
11	 The juxtaposition of the respondents’ estimation of their own religiosity from 1 (not religious) to 10 (very religious) and the number of their children reveals a clear connection.  The average number of children ranges from 1.44 for respondents who characterized themselves as non-religious to 1.9 for those who considered themselves very religious.  The rise is clear but not continuous.  Respondents who characterized themselves as not particularly religious (2,4) or somewhat religious (6,7) had fewer children than the decidedly non-religious respondents.  When respondents were asked about their religious practices – in this case prayer – the connection and the conspicuous contrast became even clearer.  The average number of children for respondents who never pray was only 1.39 compared to 2.06 for those who pray daily. 
12	While the various streams of environmentalism agree in claiming that the current patterns of economic activity are unsustainable for natural resources, they disagree in answering the following question: who is the responsible? Two different answers have been provided: the people or the socio-economic system.  The ﬁrst answer claims that people are inter-temporally greedy.  Unsustainable economic patterns simply reﬂect the little importance that current generations attribute to the living standard of future generations.  According to the second answer instead, people would prefer a more sustainable path of the economy but some failure of the socio-economic system prevent this outcome.  We provide a test of the basic hypothesis on which these two views diverge: the degree of people’s concern for the conditions of life of future generations. We derive this information by estimating the relationship between people’s current subjective well-being and their expectations about the living standard of future generations, i.e. a future far enough to concern only future generations.  According to the ﬁrst view, people’s expectations about the future should have weak or null inﬂuence on people’s current well-being. On the contrary, the second view implies that such inﬂuence should be positive and remarkable. 
13	 In 2009 the respondents from 33 European countries were asked by Eurobarometer whether they expected the younger generations to have an easier or more difﬁcult life than the one of current generations.   In this case the ﬁgures from Eurobarometer show that those with worst expectations report on average a 7.33% lower life satisfaction, that is to say a coefﬁcient two times larger than the one relative to neutral expectations.   The German General Social Survey in 2008 asked to its respondents whether they agreed or disagreed with the idea that, given the future, one can hardly take responsibility to bring children into the world.   Estimates document that those more worried for the future tend to report a 9.25% lower life satisfaction than the others.
14	 Finally, in 2007 the European Quality of Life survey asked about people’s optimism for the future in 31 European countries. Life satisfaction and happiness are available, both ranging on a 1 to 10 points scale. 
15	Theoretical work based on social identity theory and in-group favoritism predicts that increased population diversity (e.g., due to immigration) reduces support for redistributive public policies. In this article, we add to the empirical literature testing this prediction in three ways.  First, rather than ethno-linguistic or racial heterogeneity, we analyze religious diversity, which in many countries is an increasingly important source of diversity. Second, to account for the potential endogeneity of heterogeneity, we analyze an exogenous shock in diversity due to the German reuniﬁcation.  Finally, we assess shifts in local individuals’ social identiﬁcation after immigration took place, which, while untested in previous contributions, is a critical theoretical mechanism.  Our results - using tax and spending decisions of 2031 Bavarian municipalities over the 1983-2005 period - indicate that Catholic municipalities in particular signiﬁcantly reduced their level of taxes and spending in response to non-Catholic immigration.  These eﬀects arise only after the ﬁrst post-reuniﬁcation local elections, suggesting a critical mediating role of the democratic process.
16	Before turning to the robustness checks, we note that the massive migration wave following reuniﬁcation appears to have aﬀected individuals’ social identiﬁcation, particularly in ex ante Catholic Bavarian towns.  This is important because – even though this generally remains untested in previous work – the Alesina et al. (1999) and Alesina and La Ferrara (2000) framework argues that lower preferences for redistribution in heterogeneous communities are driven by individuals feeling a higher degree of altruism towards those with whom they share a common ‘identity.’ To test this, we analyzed data on the strength of individuals’ identiﬁcation with their home town and its inhabitants from the German ALLBUS surveys.  While such data are, unfortunately, available only for 1991 and 2008, this nonetheless allows us to illustrate the change in such attitudes among Catholic and Protestant Bavarians after reuniﬁcation.  This is presented in ﬁgure II, which reports the marginal effect of being Catholic on the propensity to feel strongly attached to one’s home town and its inhabitants.
17	Figure II clearly illustrates that there was no significant difference in the strength of identification of Catholics and Protestants in Bavaria in 1991 (though with Catholics feeling slightly more attached on average), but that Catholics were signiﬁcantly less likely to strongly identify with their communities in 2008, after the reuniﬁcation migration wave (statistically signiﬁcant at 10 percent).  Catholics in Bavaria thus appear to have lost their feeling of ‘common identity’ with their fellow inhabitants at the local level to a substantially larger degree than Protestant Bavarians, which – in the Alesina et al. (1999) and Alesina and La Ferrara (2000) framework – would underpin their lower preference for redistributive ﬁscal policies.  Interestingly, West German Catholics outside of Bavaria – who were less strongly subjected to non-Catholic immigration after reuniﬁcation – show the opposite pattern (with a weakly stronger local attachment after reuniﬁcation).
18	Interview falsifications in face-to-face surveys have the potential to seriously contaminate survey data.  Thus, detection methods are of crucial importance.  One idea is to use several falsification indicators derived from existing survey data.  Here, real and falsified data are compared in two experimental studies.  Response sets are used to develop formal indicators, and content of responses is used to develop content-related indicators. During the analysis, numerous formal indicators are tested and compared with content-related indicators. The results indicate that the majority of formal indicators allow for differentiation between real and false data, and, in addition, certain content-related indicators are useful for such differentiation.  The results are discussed in terms of the usefulness of indicators in identifying potential falsifiers.
19	Another explanation for mixed results could be differences in the questionnaires used in the two studies.  For example, in the case of rounding as an indicator, questions about income varied between the two studies.  It was not appropriate to ask the students about their total household net income, although this was asked about in the ALLBUS (and in Study 1).  Instead, incomes from different sources — parents and relatives, foundations, jobs — were asked about in the second study.  The classic total net income question commonly used in surveys poses memory problems for real respondents, resulting in high rounding. In contrast, in the case of specific single questions used in the second study, students knew the requested information and reported it exactly, whereas falsifiers had problems providing exact information.  Thus, falsifiers produced more round numerical answers than real respondents. 
20	This article examines how electoral outcomes nurture democratic sentiment. Elections generate winners and losers, and voters alter their beliefs in ways that are congruent with electoral choices. Yet, while winning and losing shape democratic sentiment, comparatively less is known about the intermediary influences through which this relationship flows.  Analysing data from the Federal Republic of Germany, this article probes for contextually driven effects using cross-level modelling of German General Social Surveys (Allgemeine Bevölkerungs Umfrage der Sozialwissenschaften). Four hypotheses are tested at the individual level, with the results confirming the following.  First, winners’ democratic sentiments remain firm in the context of electoral stalemate, but are mediated through their ideological proximity to the party for which they voted.  Second, time conditions winners’ democratic sentiments, but in discrepant ways in the east and west of the country.  There is no evidence that the western relationship has systematically weakened over a 20-year period.  The eastern relationship, meanwhile, was especially strong following unification, but stabilised thereafter.  In demonstrating that winners’ attitudes are influenced by political context and time, the article presents a more refined analysis and a more comprehensive account, and develops fresh lines of inquiry into the structure of mass democratic sentiment.
21	The empirical analysis commences by examining winners’ and losers’ political satisfaction in Germany, beginning in the west.  Two clear points emerge from Figure 1. First, winners are more politically satisfied compared with losers, including those who voted for the Black–Red Grand Coalition.  But the consistency with which this finding is confirmed is striking when one considers that the first three time points all relate to the same government – a government moreover that held power for 16 years.  Persistent dividends of support across so tumultuous a period are remarkably impressive evidence of the importance and durability of winning.  But it would be a misreading of the data to infer that winning increments of supportive attitudes are inevitable, for a second point from the Figure concerns the only instance in which political satisfaction was indistinguishable between winners and losers.  This was in 2002 – towards the end of the first term of Gerhard Schröder’s Red–Green government.  The unpopularity of the Red–Green government at this time is well-known, but the sheer scale of its mass unpopularity is underlined by the fact that unlike any government for which there are comparable data, and merely four years after its inauguration, it no longer carried additional dividends of political satisfaction from those who had voted for it.  Our first glimpse at the data reveals contrasts between winners’ support: on the one hand, there is evidence of its tenacity and stability; on the other hand, there is evidence of the rapidity with which it can drain away. 
22	The quantitative models develop the analysis. In every model, the dependent variable is political satisfaction.  The main independent variable is winning and losing, measured by the ‘zweitestimme’ question, which asks for the party for which respondents voted in the most recent Federal election.  More details on the survey questions and recoding procedures are provided in the Appendix.  The analyses are conducted in three stages.  In the first stage, regression models establish the effect of winning on political satisfaction, with different models produced over the periods for which there are data.  This permits analysis of if and how voters’ response to the Grand Coalition changed compared with that of previous governments.  Separate regressions are run for eastern and western Germany.  The second stage focuses exclusively on the Grand Coalition.  A series of multivariate regression models investigate whether: (1) political satisfaction differs between CDU–CSU and SPD voters; and (2) whether political satisfaction varies by ideological proximity.  Ideological proximity was calculated as the difference between the individual’s self-reported placement on the Left–Right scale and their Left–Right placement of the party for which they voted.
23	By applying event-history analysis to all available waves of the German Socio- Economic Panel, we analyze how remigration intentions and actual remigration of Turkish migrants to Germany have evolved over time.  The study draws from a broad set of theoretical approaches to remigration and it takes a different focus than previous studies by concentrating on long-term change in these rates.  Our findings reveal an increase in remigration intentions and rates for first generation migrants after the turn of the millennium.  Those who plan to return have a stronger emotional attachment to Turkey than those who plan to stay.  We thus argue that for first-generation migrants from Turkey after 2001, rising remigration intentions and actual remigration are unrelated to their integration into German society.  Rather, the increase seems to be triggered by macro-structural changes in the country of origin.
24	In Germany, children of Turkish immigrants are not automatically citizens.  They become German by birth only if their parents fulfill certain requirements such as legal stay in the country for 8 years.  Even these children must decide between the ages of 18 and 23 if they wish to be Turkish or German citizens since double citizenship is not accepted on a regular basis.   Most importantly, German perception of cultural distance between Germans and Turks have increased substantially between 1996 and 2006.   Means on a 7-point scale (1=low and 7=high distance) have increased from 4.09 (males) and 4.15 (females) in 1996 to 5.14 (males) and 5.24 (females) in 2006.   In the same time span, the German perception of distance with Italians and ethnic Germans has remained stable or even declined.   Own analysis based on data from the ALLBUS (available under http://www.gesis.org/allbus). Demographics.
25	Germany has by facto been receiving immigrants for the last decades, but the government only began actively dealing with the long-term impact of immigration a decade ago .  This is partly because Germany has perceived immigration as a temporary phenomenon for a long time.  Since the 1990s, Germany shifted away from stemming flows to recognizing its identity as a country of immigration and managing the impact of immigration on society .  The policy shift is partly due to steadily declining immigration to Germany . Most importantly, the shift is fueled by the German Government's realization that policies must foster integration among immigrants who have been living there for many years, some of whom were born in Germany. 
26	"The perception of difference towards Turkish immigrants remains today.  In a 2006 ALLBUS poll, respondents were asked how they would react if an Italian or Turk were to marry a family member: 24 percent of the respondents stated they would not be pleased at all to have a Turk marrying a family member; only 4 percent stated the same for an Italian.  A 2008 Allensbach survey found that 76 percent of the respondents agree that Turkish immigrants ""have a totally different culture,"" while 73 percent say they ""think totally differently than we do about a lot of things."" "
27	 Results of more recent public opinion such as the Allbus Survey conducted in 2006, show that the majority of Germans continue to reject the idea of generally granting dual citizenship.  Asked to indicate the degree to which they agreed or disagreed with the idea of allowing immigrants to naturalize without relinquishing their former citizenship, 40 percent of respondents strongly agreed and 54 percent rejected the idea to some degree. 
28	‘Sustainable development is a development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.’ (WCED 1987)  Aims and objectives of the research project GeNECA  Sustainability policy has to consider the interdependencies of human life and nature; it has to meet the high moral standards of intra- and intergenerational justice set by the Brundtland Commission in 1987; and, finally, it has to motivate people to behave accordingly.   This is quite a challenging task that often is responded to in a too simplistic way.  Current sustainability science and civic engagement often focus on the environmental dimensions and herewith on intergenerational justice.  To investigate whether users of community currencies hold a more dematerialized idea of quality of life, two questions were posed in the survey. One aimed at an assessment if “less emphasis on money and material possessions” would be a good or bad thing to strive for. 
29	" Comparing the responses of the users of a community currency to those of the general population (data Euro barometer 72.4, survey 2009) there is a clear difference: 89% of users of a community currency evaluate the statement ""less emphasis on money and material possessions“ as a good thing, whereas just 61% of the general population share this opinion.  This difference is statistically significant. "
30	 The post-materialistic orientation is represented by 27% in the average population (cf. ALLBUS 2010), compared to 37% in the sample of users of community currencies. 
31	E-mail is a common invitation mode for Web surveys.  This invitation mode is cheap, is easy to automate and personalize, and provides easy access to the survey (a clickable URL).  However, there are a growing number of problems with e-mail as an invitation mode, including concerns about spam, the rapid turnover (churn) of e-mail addresses, the fact that many sample frames do not contain e-mail addresses, privacy concerns about providing e-mail addresses when solicited, and the inability to deliver a prepaid incentive.  The use of e-mail invitations in Web surveys may be one factor in the relatively low response rates compared to mail surveys (Lozar Manfreda et al. 2008; Shih and Fan 2008). One often-employed strategy to counteract this nonresponse problem is the use of pre-notification.  In mail surveys, research has consistently shown that pre-notification in the same mode (i.e., advance letters) tend to increase response rates (see Couper 2008; Dillman et al. 2009).  However, research exploring pre-notification for Web surveys suggests that pre-notification in another mode may be more effective (see Bosnjak et al. 2008; Kaplowitz et al. 2004; in contrast see Porter and Whitcomb 2007).  Using pre-notification in another mode like a postcard or mailed letter may attract greater attention and more legitimacy to the subsequent e-mail invitation (see Bosnjak et al. 2008).
32	 At the end of the ALLBUS interview all respondents were asked whether they use the Internet. There were 1,869 Internet users (66 percent of respondents).  All Internet users were then asked whether they were willing to participate in a scientific follow-up survey conducted by GESIS Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences.  Among those asked, 1,492 persons (80 percent of the 1,869) expressed willingness to participate.  In a following question, this group was asked whether they would provide their e-mail address.  Altogether 667 persons provided their e-mail address (45 percent of the 1,492).  Compared to those persons who did not provide their e-mail address (n = 825) these 667 persons are higher educated (51 vs. 38 percent) and are less likely to be female (43 vs. 53 percent).  These people are also more likely to agree with the statement “most people can be trusted” (26 vs. 21 percent). 
33	Traditionally, bowing to the migration history of Germany, larger proportions of foreigners live in major German cities than in other parts of the country.  According to contact theory, famously developed by social psychologist Gordon Allport in the 1950s, intergroup contacts between different ethnic groups reduce prejudice.  The main aim of the article is to examine whether the level of prejudice toward foreigners is lower among the German urban population due to greater contact opportunities and habituation among different ethnic groups in Germany’s major cities, which reduces prejudice as well.  The presented findings show, first, that prejudice is only slightly lower in the major cities.  Second, this finding crucially depends on the quality of contacts.  Only friendships between Germans and foreigners show a significant impact on reducing prejudice.  Clearly, beyond the level of acquaintance with individual members of an out-group, only voluntary contacts are able to diminish prejudice.  Third, in terms of spatial context effects, the switch between majority and minority group positions in residential areas appears to be a tipping point for prejudice, which means that even people with low levels of prejudice wish to live as the ethnic majority in their respective residential area. 
34	Table 3: Variables for the Measurement of Prejudice Toward Foreigners Discriminating sanctions toward foreigners  Foreigners should adapt more to the German way of life  Foreigners should not be allowed to engage in political activities  Foreigners should go home when jobs in Germany get scarce  Foreigners should marry people of their own nationality 
35	Negative consequences due to the presence of foreigners  Foreigners commit crimes more often than Germans  Foreigners are a burden to the German social welfare system  Due to the presence of foreigners, I feel like a stranger in my own country  Foreigners take jobs away from Germans  Foreigners are the reason for shortages in the German housing market 
36	People in the major cities are better educated than in other parts of Germany.  They are less German since birth, which means that in major cities more initially foreign nationals acquire German citizenship. The desire to live in German-only neighborhoods is also less pronounced. In terms of contacts with foreigners, one can see that the theoretically assumed greater contact opportunities in major cities of over 500,000 inhabitants result in higher intergroup contacts.  The descriptive statistics of contacts between Germans and foreigners show that higher levels of contact habituation in major cities (Pettigrew et al. 2007) lead to more actual inter-group contacts.  According to the findings of contact theory, this should lead to lower levels of prejudice (Hypothesis 1) mediated by the percentage of minority population in a definite area (Hypothesis 2).  The results of the test of Hypotheses 1 and 2 are shown in Table 5.
37	Model 1 examines the individual predictors.  The strongest predictor of prejudice is “school education,” which means that the longer an individual is part of the school system, the lower the level of prejudice.   This relationship corresponds with the self-rating of social class.  Therefore, education on the individual level is the strongest predictor for prejudice toward minority groups and is even significant in all other models.  Education could, thus, be seen as highly relevant to intergroup relationships and living with difference (Valentine 2008). 
38	Adding contact variables in Model 4 validates these findings.  The items “school education,” “attitudes toward diverse neighborhoods,” and “life-style differences” remain important predictors for prejudice in the model, but living in a major city is only slightly significant in Model 4.  With respect to the contact items, it is only intergroup contact in the respondents’ own circles of friends that is a significant predictor for reducing prejudice.  These findings are similar to the modifications of contact theory by Pettigrew, who demonstrates that especially intergroup friendship reduces prejudice by contact (Pettigrew and Tropp 2006; Pettigrew et al. 2011).  Intergroup contacts at work, in the neighborhood, and in the family do not appear to have any influence in Model 4.  More specifically, only contacts based on personal choice are effective in reducing prejudice. 
39	To value whether these lower levels of prejudice are a function of education or the constitution of the social environment, Model 3 includes the percentage of foreigners, local intergroup relationships, attitudes toward ethnic diversity, and lifestyle differences in the analysis.  The result confirms that attitudes toward ethnically diverse neighborhoods and lifestyle differences are crucial.  Neither the percentage of foreign population nor the perceived local relations between Germans and foreigners are significant predictors.  The model underlines that education, living in a major city and attitudes toward lifestyle differences and ethnically diverse neighborhoods are far more important factors. 
40	Despite the enormous progress toward gender equality in most Western societies over the past several decades, many of the gender gaps in labour market outcomes persist.  Across OECD countries women, on average, earn less than men, are less likely to be active in the labour market and, if they are, supply fewer hours of work.  They are more likely to interrupt their employment for child-rearing or to provide other family-related services. A major reason for these diﬀerences stems from men’s and women’s individual choices (regarding education, occupation, industry, employer, etc.), and may therefore be viewed as the expression of their individual preferences.  Since we observe a systematic gender diﬀerence in these choices, this view suggests that male and female preferences regarding their labour market activity diﬀer quite substantially on average
41	Dependent variables: work and career preferences  To estimate the gender gaps in work preferences, we use three measures as outcome variables: the importance of (1) job and work; (2) high income; and (3) good promotion opportunity.  The ALLBUS asks respondents to evaluate these and other life aspects and job attributes on a 7-point Likert-type scale, where a higher value corresponds with higher importance. All items are presented to the respondents in a random order and are evaluated independently from each other. 
42	Our set of controls can broadly be divided into three categories: preference, socio-demographic and macro-level controls.  By including the preference control variables we evaluate the priority respondents assign to work and job attributes of high income and promotion opportunities conditional on competing means of time use or other job attributes, respectively.  The reason that we are interested to learn about the conditional importance of work and extrinsic attributes (among alternative options) is that we assume an individual to maximise her utility under constraints, i.e., to prioritise according to her preferences when choosing her hours of labour supply or her profession. To achieve this, we make use of the wide variety of items the ALLBUS provides, which, just as for our dependent variables, request respondents to evaluate other life aspects and job characteristics on the same Likert-type scale.  In the regressions that focus on preferences for work we include the evaluation of the importance of: own family and children, leisure and relaxation, friends and acquaintances, and relatives – as they represent competing means of time-use. A probit regression using these life aspects as independent variables conﬁrms that a higher ceteris paribus evaluation of the importance of work in our sample corresponds with a higher probability of being employed. 
43	Our findings for the German case contrast evidence for the United States.  On the other hand, recent studies on polarization of mass opinion in the UK ( Adams, Green and Milazzo, 2012a,b)or the Netherlands (Adams, Vries and Leiter, 2011) have reported trends of depolarization rather than polarization as well.  We hesitate to interpret existing evidence in this young research held as evidence for institutionally or elite induced movements in public opinion.  Too little is known about the interplay between elite and mass polarization.  This could help to view current movements which seem to have caught re on single issues like the conversion plans of the Taksim Gezi Park in Turkey, protest against massive surveillance of Internet traffic by intelligence agencies or recent protest against racist behavior by officials in Ferguson following the shooting of Michael Brown in a broader, temporal context.
44	Do you think one should get married if one is living with a partner on a permanent basis?  “Should abortion be permitted . . . if the woman is married and doesn’t want any more children (. . . if the family has a very low income and can’t afford more children, . . . if the woman is unmarried and doesn’t want to marry the child’s father, . . . if that is what the woman wants, regardless of her reasons)?” “A doctor gives an incurably ill patient a lethal drug on his/her request.”  “Somebody smokes marijuana several times a week.”  “A man has a homosexual relationship with another man.” 
45	“If social welfare benefits such as continued pay for sick workers, unemployment compensation and early retirement pensions are as high as they are now, it only makes people not want to work anymore.” “The economy can run only if the businessmen make good profits. That benefits everyone in the end.”  “Generally speaking, business profits are distributed fairly in Germany.”  “Even if one wanted to, there is no way to reduce social inequality any further than here in Germany.”  “Only if differences in income and social standing are large enough is there an incentive for individual effort.”  “Differences in social standing between people are acceptable because they basically reflect what people made out of the opportunities they had.”  “All in all, I think the social differences in this country are just.”   People seeking asylum? (Should entry be restricted or not?)  People from non-EU countries, e.g. Turkey coming to work here? (Should entry be restricted or not?)  “The foreigners living in Germany should adapt their way of life a little more closely to the German way of life.”  “Foreigners living in Germany should choose to marry people of their own nationality.”  “When jobs get scarce, the foreigners living in Germany should be sent home again.”  “Foreigners living in Germany should be prohibited from taking part in any kind of political activity.” 
46	We apply an innovative technique to allow for differential effects of physical appearance and self-confidence across the wage distribution, as traditional methods can confound opposing effects at either end of the wage distribution.  Comparing the effects of beauty and confidence measures in two countries (Germany and Luxembourg), we find that wages are more driven by looks than self-esteem.  Counterfactual wage distributions, constructed using distribution regression, show a beauty premium for women at the bottom of the wage distribution.   However, most of this is explained by the fact that attractive women have better labor market attributes than their unattractive counterparts.  We find a large wage premium for attractive men throughout the wage distribution which is largely unexplained by labor market attributes.   There is a small wage penalty for self-confident individuals, particularly men, although their labor market characteristics are generally better than their less confident counterparts.  We show that the difference in characteristics between beautiful and plain people contributes to the beauty premium identified using traditional models, particularly for women.  Isolating the characteristic effect from the unexplained effect of beauty on wages leads to smaller beauty premium for women. 
47	In Germany, the interviewer is asked at the beginning and at the end of the interview: Please assess the attractiveness of the respondent. Please come to a spontaneous decision.  This is on a scale of 1 to 11, where 1 is ’unattractive and 11 ’attractive’.  We interpret this as an objective measure of beauty.  The respondent is also asked to assess their own physical appearance on the same scale.  We interpret this subjective measure as conﬁdence. 5 The mean and median response is 7 for conﬁdence and 7.7 and 8 respectively, for objective beauty.  Consequently, we deﬁne an individual as being attractive if the objective variable equals 8-11, and unattractive if it equals 1-7.  The individual is classed as conﬁdent if the subjective variable equals 7-11 and unconﬁdent otherwise. 
48	 Over the past two decades, many countries around the globe have made great improvements in eradicating gender gaps in many aspects of public life.   Yet, recent data suggests that gender gaps, especially in politics, have stagnated.   Academics, policy makers and political pundits suggest the cultural barriers to gender equality based on traditional norms about gender roles might go a long way explaining this stagnation.  To empirically examine the complex relationship between policy programmers, gender norms and political gender gaps has proven extremely difficult most likely due to drawbacks associated with the use of typical cross-national data, such as unit heterogeneity or endogeneity.  This study exploits the separation and unification of Germany to shed more light on this important relationship.  By focussing on the German case and drawing upon data from the German General Social Survey (1990-2012), we can gain causal leverage by comparing differences in citizens’ attitudes towards gender and their impact on political participation across birth cohorts in the two German regions that were socialised in starkly different gender regimes.   Two important findings stand out. First, we show that gender policies matter.   While birth cohorts in East and West who were socialised before or after the Cold War display similar gender attitudes, we find significant differences between the East and West for birth cohorts socialised during Cold War: those from the West hold conservative gender attitudes compared to those from the East.   Second, we demonstrate that these differences in gender attitudes have important effects for gender gaps in political participation.   Overall, the political gender gap in the East tends to be smaller compared to the West, and traditional gender attitudes are on average negatively correlated with political participation and that the relative negative effect is greater for women than for men.   This finding is robust when we deal with endogeneity concerns.  Our evidence lends credence to the claim that an adverse gender culture might indeed by an important impediment to the closing of political gender gaps. 
49	How can we capture citizens’ gender norms? We rely responses to six statements included in the ALLBUS survey that relate to citizens’ views about gender roles:  I. 'A working mother can establish just as loving and secure a relationship with her children as a mother who doesn't work'  II. 'It is more important for a wife to help her husband's career than to have one herself' III. 'A pre-school child is likely to suffer if his or her mother works'  IV. ‘It is much better for everyone involved if the man is the achiever outside the home and the woman takes care of the home and family'  V. 'A child actually benefits from his or her mother having a job rather than just concentrating on the home'  VI. 'A married woman should not work if there is a limited number if jobs and her husband is able to support the family'  For each statement, there are 4 possible responses ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 4 (strongly disagree).  Each variable was recoded in such a way that 1 corresponds to egalitarian and 4 to traditional attitudes toward gender roles.  Traditional attitudes are understood to be those, which view women’s responsibilities to be primarily in the private sphere, i.e. agreement with statements II to IV, and VI, and disagreement with statements I and V. 
50	The extent to which popular support for the welfare state depends on income varies greatly across nations and policy domains.  We argue and show formally that these variations - largely overlooked yet essential to understanding the politics of redistribution - reflect in part the design of tax and transfer policies in terms of progressivity.  When progressivity is high, politics is perceived by income groups as a zero sum game and conflicts over who gets what intensify.  When progressivity is low, and tax contributors and benefit recipients overlap, redistributive struggles become politically less salient. We test these predictions both across nations and across policy domains within a sample of advanced industrial democracies. Our findings indicate that the progressivity of the tax and transfer system is a major determinant of the predictive power of income on preferences for redistribution.
51	Germany—evolution of income slopes.  Source. Based on the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS), 1980-2010 (GESIS—Leibniz- Institut für Sozialwissenschaften, 2012). Note. Shown are Best Linear Unbiased Predictors (BLUPs) from multi-level models (individuals nested in time).  Dependent variable: Preferences for “state should secure income in times of hardship” (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = agree, 4 = strongly agree).   In particular, we explore the predictive power of income on the response to the following statement: “the state should secure income in times of hardship” with responses ranging from strong disagreement (1) to strong agreement (4). German question wording: “Der Staat muss dafuer sorgen, dass man auch bei Krankheit, Not, Arbeitslosigkeit und im Alter ein gutes Auskommen hat.” Controls variables are gender, age, marital status, and education.  Sample restricted to respondents aged 18 to 60 and (full- or part-time) employed. ALLBUS = Allgemeine Bevölkerungsumfrage der Sozialwissenschaften. 
52	Prior research examining punitive attitudes has typically focused on the United States and citizens’ support for the death penalty or American “get- tough” criminal policies.  Yet, little is known as to how punitive attitudes and their sources vary internationally. Using Germany as a case study, this article expands the scope of punitiveness research by examining how factors typically examined in American studies, such as cynicism, institutional trust, law and order culture, and antiminority attitudes, relate to citizen beliefs about punishment in a different cultural context. Findings suggest that distrust of the judicial system, political prioritization of law and order, and antiminority attitudes predict citizens’ support for severe punishment as an effective crime-reduction technique.  Implications and directions for future research are highlighted. 
53	 Dependent variable.  The dependent variable is a measure of respondents’ belief in severe punishment, worded as a yes/no survey question: “Do you think crime can be reduced by severe punishment?” Responses were recoded so that a positive response (1) indicates respondents’ favoring severe punishment as an effective method of crime reduction.   As the dependent variable is dichotomous, logistic regression is used to assess individual predictors of respondents’ attitudes toward severe punishment.  Demographics. We use several demographic measures, including age, gender, income, marital status, and education.  Age and income (thousands of Euros per month) are included as continuous variables, and gender (1 = male), education (1 = past or current enrollment in college/university), and marital status (1 = married) are included as dichotomous variables.  Researchers who have studied punitive attitudes in Germany have also noted the importance of analyzing differences between East and West Germans (Albrecht, 2008; Kury et al., 2009).  Kury et al. (2009) review a possible carry-over effect in Communist authoritarianism among East Germans, attitudes that in principle create a major focus on law and order, while also highlighting East Germans’ propensity to view certain criminal acts as more severe than their West German counterparts.  The analyses presented below control for inherent differences in punitive attitudes between East and West Germans with a dichotomous variable for an East (=1) or West (=0) German resident. 
54	Covariates of punitive attitudes. Prior studies have found that those who are cynical about the moral and social relationships among society members will be more likely to be punitive, because they are less likely to believe that criminals can be rehabilitated, and because citizens believe that softer approaches to punishing offenders is unlikely to restore social order or improve moral and value standards (Tyler Boeckmann, 1997; Unnever Cullen, 2010). It is also reasonable to believe that citizens who have more positive outlooks on their lives in general, or who broadly feel “good” about their current situation, will be less likely to believe in severe punishment if they are more likely to be optimistic about the effects that punishment and also rehabilitation may have on offenders.  Here, three measures are included to assess the effects of these attitudes on citizens’ punitive beliefs.  Two measures of cynicism are included: social cynicism (“Most people do not really care what happens to the next fellow”) and political cynicism (“Most politicians are not really interested in the problems of the average man”).  For both, respondents were asked whether they agree or disagree with these statements, and the responses were recoded so that a positive response (1) indicates feelings of the designated type of cynicism.  We also include a measure that we label as “life satisfaction,“ which is a four-category item asking respondents the following: “All things considered, have your ideas of what you wanted to achieve in life been (1) more than fulfilled, (2) fulfilled, (3) not quite fulfilled, and (4) not at all fulfilled?” This item was reverse coded so that higher values indicate increased feelings of life fulfillment or satisfaction.  Although life satisfaction has not been previously included with measures of cynicism and social-moral outlooks as a possible predictor of punitiveness, we believe that individuals’ broad views — that can either be negative or positive, pessimistic or optimistic — influence their punitive attitudes.  This specific item captures a broad range of positive or negative feelings about individuals’ lives as they currently stand, which may bear on their beliefs about crime and punishment.
55	We also assess two aspects commonly associated with punitive views: political prioritization of law and order and a measure of racial attitudes specifically relevant for Germany in the form of anti-immigrant attitudes.  Law and order as a political priority is measured by a survey item that asks respondents of these four choices, which do they view as the most-important political goal: maintaining law and order, protecting the right of free speech, more citizen influence on political decisions, or fighting rising prices.  A dichotomous variable was created in which respondents who selected law and order as the most-important political goal were coded as 1, and all other responses were coded as 0.  To measure anti-immigrant sentiments, a four-item scale was created (α = .72) from responses to questions regarding citizens’ beliefs about immigration for four groups: asylum seekers, EU workers, non-EU workers, and ethnic Germans. Respondents were asked to choose one of the three responses for each group: (a) entry should be unrestricted, (b) entry should be restricted, and (c) entry should be stopped completely. Higher values indicate more restrictive or anti-immigration views.  Respondents were asked to choose one of the three responses for each group: (a) entry should be unrestricted, (b) entry should be restricted, and (c) entry should be stopped completely.  Higher values indicate more restrictive or anti-immigration views.
56	There is literature indicating that religion and conservatism influence citizens’ punitive attitudes (Applegate et al., 2000; Grasmick et al., 1993; Grasmick and McGill, 1994; Johnson, 2001; D. G. Taylor et al., 1979; Young, 1992), and we incorporate measures of those concepts as well.  Religion is a measure of self-reported religiousness in which respondents were asked to denote how religious they believed themselves to be (1 = not at all religious to 10 = very religious).  Conservative values are included using a similar measure, in which respondents placed themselves on a continuum of political views, the farther left indicates more liberal, farther right indicates more conservative.  The item was coded so that higher values (from 1 to 10) indicate increased conservatism. 
57	The effect of citizens’ distrust of government and criminal justice institutions on punitive attitudes has been well researched and findings suggest that distrust of the judicial system is likely to be related to a favoring of more severe criminal punishment because of citizens’ belief that courts are too liberal or too soft on crime (Simon, 2007; Unnever and Cullen, 2010).  However, the police as a criminal justice institution are often viewed to be a different and nearly autonomous law-enforcement body in relation to the judicial side, and researchers have hypothesized that distrust in the police may have the opposite effect when compared with court distrust, in that citizens who do not trust police officers will be less likely to favor severe punishment (Simon, 2007). Separate measures of judicial distrust and police distrust are included, where respondents were asked on a scale of 1 to 7 (1 = absolutely no trust, 7 = a great deal of trust) how much they trusted either institution.  Each variable was coded dichotomously so that responses reporting distrust (values from 1-3) were coded as 1, indicating distrust for the specified institution. 
58	Based on these studies, we would expect those who are more deviant to be less punitive and those who have strong fears of crime, as well as those who have been criminally victimized, to be more punitive.  Victimization and fear of crime are dichotomous, with “1” indicating positive responses to either of the two following questions: “Have you been a victim of theft in the past 3 years?” and “Is there any place in the immediate vicinity in which you fear walking alone at night?”  Prior deviant activity is measured with a four-item additive scale, which includes categorical measures of respondents’ frequency for fare dodging, drunk driving, tax fraud, and shoplifting. 
59	This paper exploits Germany’s recent history of separation and reunification to identify the effects of an unexpected change in the school system on individual entrepreneurial intentions.  East German students experienced a sudden change from socialist schooling to entrepreneurial schooling under the free market system.  Using a difference-in-differences framework, we compare East German students with 0-10 years of entrepreneurial schooling to a West German control group. We estimate that one additional year of entrepreneurial schooling increases students’ entrepreneurial intentions by about 4.9 percent. Controlling for parents’ values and norms supports our argument that we measure an effect of schooling on entrepreneurial intentions that is not confounded by the social environment.  Robustness tests include matching and student fixed effects confirm the validity of our results. 
60	The German General Social Survey (ALLBUS) is a biennial, representative surveys of the German population collected in personal interviews. We use 4 waves conducted after the reunification in 1991, 1994, 1998, and 2000. Those waves contain the respondents’ level of agreement to the statements “Income differences give incentives to work hard.”, “Rank differences are performance based and therefore acceptable”, and “Differences in social status are just — by and large.”  Bauernschuster et al. (2012) show that the answers to these questions reflect norms shaped under socialism that are unfavorable of entrepreneurship.  Answers are given on a scale from -2 to +2. For each individual with children, we calculate a variable indicating “socialist attitudes” by summing up his or her answer scores and dividing it by the highest number of socialist “scores” possible, given the number of questions answered.  Accordingly, our norm variable ranges from -1 indicating a liberal attitude to +1 indicating a socialist attitude.  We furthermore use information on the respondents’ occupation, gender, and age, to merge mothers and fathers from the ALLBUS survey to individual observations from the student survey according to the students’ parents’ occupation.  We merge each ALLBUS wave to the students’ survey wave that had been conducted closest to the time. 
61	We provide empirical evidence that social norms and values related to competition and self-reliance that are developed under a socialist regime persist after the regime’s breakdown and that these implicit norms hinder the development of an entrepreneurial spirit.  To separate the effect of implicit norms from formal institutions, we look at East Germany, which adopted the formal institutions of a market economy overnight when unifying with West Germany.  We show that persistent differences in social norms and values between East and West Germans can be explained by past socialist socialization rather than by individual characteristics and differences in economic development. 
62	Table 1: Norms, values, and attitudes expected to relate to entrepreneurship. Do you agree?  “The state has to care for the sick, poor, old, and unemployed.”  “Everybody should get the money he needs - regardless of any performance.”  “Income differences give incentives to work hard.”  “Rank differences are performance based and therefore acceptable.”  “Differences in social status are just—by and large.”  “Economic profits are distributed fairly in Germany.”  “The current social security system reduces work incentives.”  What would you say? “How important is a secure job to you?” 
63	 In the ALLBUS survey, individuals are asked which party they would vote for if there were general elections the subsequent Sunday. We create two dummies as our outcome variables. The first takes on the value of unity for those saying they would vote for the more rightist/liberal parties (CDU and FDP); zero otherwise.  The second outcome variable is unity for individuals stating they would vote for the more leftist parties; zero otherwise.  We include all covariates from the previous regressions, i.e., gender, age (and its square), education, previous unemployment spells, marital status, a dummy for house/flat owners, the logarithm of real personal income, and year dummies.  The results of this exercise are displayed in Table 4.  Clearly, we have multivariate evidence that our attitudes are truly meaningful since they are correlated with expressed voting behavior.  To check the robustness of these associations, we used a different voting variable as our outcome, where individuals were asked to state which party they voted for in the last general elections. The results are virtually identical to those presented in Table 4. 
64	The 20th century has seen the rise of international sports and of sportive nationalism.  While Mussolini and Hitler demonstrated early how symbolic benefits can be reaped from international sport events, the so-called “politicization” of international sports, that is, the use of sport as a vehicle for identity politics, has heavily intensified after World War II (Tomlinson and Young, 2006).  International sport events, in particular the Olympic Games, turned into an arena of the Cold War after the Soviet government had decided to participate in the 1952 Olympics in order to broadcast the message of communist superiority (Allison and Monnington, 2002).  In particular, the two Germanys (the Federal Republic of Germany [FRG] and the German Democratic Republic [GDR]) became involved in a fierce “Cold War on the dirt track” (Balbier, 2005).  In both parts of Germany, athletic success was regarded as a cue for general productivity and efficiency of the country.  Furthermore, in the GDR sport became a vehicle for increasing the legitimacy of the socialist regime and for creating a distinct East German national identity (Holzweißig, 1995; Krebs, 1995).
65	Research presented here uses the GGSS measures for domain-specific national pride and general national pride. Furthermore, sociodemographic indicators as well as political orientations are used as covariates in the models.  These control variables are fully described in the Appendix.  Domain-specific national pride was assessed in each wave with questions addressing various German institutions and achievements: (a) the German constitution (“Grundgesetz”), (b) the German parliament (“Bundestag”), (c) achievements of German athletes, (d) economic achievements, (e) German art and literature, (f) scientific achievements, and (g) services of the welfare state.  Respondents were told to choose up to three institutions or achievements, which make them proud of Germany.  Across all GGSS waves, about 75% of respondent indicated the maximum number of three sources of pride, 15% reported to be proud of at least one or two of said institutions or achievements, and another 10% spontaneously replied not to be proud of any of the above-mentioned aspects.  Based on these data, our operational definition of sport related national pride is thus located on a relational level: Compared with six other possible sources of pride, respondents had to rank the achievements of athletes among the top three to be considered sportive nationalists. 
66	The study was designed as a follow-up to the 2012 German General Social Survey (ALLBUS).  The ALLBUS is based on a random sample of German speaking adults, with persons randomly selected from the community registers.  Data collection is by in-person interviews, using computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI).  The 2012 ALLBUS achieved a response rate of 37.6 percent. 
67	The Internet access status of all ALLBUS respondents was ascertained.  All respondents were asked if they were willing to participate in a follow-up survey.  (This is a requirement of the German data protection laws.)  Among those with Internet access and who reported willingness to do a follow-up survey, a random 1/3 was asked for their e-mail address, while the remaining 2/3 was not asked this question.  This process (outlined in Figure 1) yields four groups of willing respondents: A) Those with Internet access who were not asked for an e-mail address B) Those with Internet access who were asked for an e-mail address and provided it C) Those with Internet access who were asked for an e-mail address and did not provide it D) Those without Internet access 
68	When comparing the responses to attitude and opinion measures, we note that mode effects could account for some of the differences, given that the follow-up survey was self-administered while ALLBUS was interviewer administered. Nonetheless, we see a clear gradient, with the addition of the mail responses bringing the distributions more in line with the ALLBUS responses.  For instance, 23 percent of Web respondents agree with the statement that “with the future looking as it does, it’s almost irresponsible to bring children into the world,” compared with 31 percent of Web+mail respondents and 37 percent of ALLBUS respondents.   Similarly, 53 percent of Web respondents endorse the statement “most people don’t care in the slightest what happens to others,” while 58 percent of Web+mail respondents and 72 percent of ALLBUS respondents do so.  We similarly see increasing levels of distrust in others and decreasing levels of interest in politics as we move from the Web respondents only to Web+mail, and finally to ALLBUS respondents. 
69	 Nelson Mandela once said that sports have the power “to change the world… to inspire… to unite people” (Carlin, Kennedy, Bechtel, Cannella, 2008).  He spoke these words before the 1995 rugby World Cup that helped to unite the post-apartheid country of South Africa.   In studying poignant sporting events - the 2006 World Cup in Germany, the 2008 Beijing Olympics, and the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa - South Africa can gain important lessons in how to use their hosting of the 2010 World Cup to promote positive change throughout society.  Though South Africa may have a difficult time controlling the racism that accompanies soccer games, in taking advice from the successes of previous tournaments, they can discover not only how to instill positive values on the field but outside the sporting context as well.
70	This graph shows significantly lower levels of positive national pride and significantly higher levels of negative national pride in Germany compared to other comparable countries.  In measuring the levels of national pride between West and East Germany between 1996 and 2006, there appears to be a marked increase in levels of nationalism (see Figure 2).  In addition, Social Survey Data (Allbus, 2006) was gathered before, during, and after the 2006 World Cup to measure the influence of the games on German society.   There was an increase from 71% of the population stating they were “very proud” or “fairly proud” a few months before the games to 78% of the population stating they possessed these positive feelings during the games.  In the months immediately following, however levels of national pride returned to the normal levels present before (see Figure 3).  Xenophobia is seen as the negative possible side effect accompanying nationalism.  In Germany, this fear of outsiders is primarily present in anti-Semitism, anti-Slavism, and anti-Islamism attitude. 
71	This note analyzes earning differentials between foreigners and natives in Germany.   Following Borjas (1994), and Altonji and Blank (1999), differences in wages or earnings of immigrants are mostly explained by variation in productivity.   Economic theory explains why immigrants face lower average earnings than natives.   Lower human capital such as lower levels of education or inferior language skills lead to low wage employment, by sorting in low income occupations and sectors.  Another explanation is a mismatch of offered and demanded skills and qualifications, or selection into self-employment.  However, parts of the income penalties may be explained by taste discrimination, as well.
72	 We use the recently published German social survey data (ALLBUS) for the year 2012 to perform Mincer-style quintile regressions for monthly earnings.   The two main dependent variables are being born outside Germany and not having German citizenship.   This allows analyzing differences in naturalization and the resulting affects to the immigrant-native pay gap.  In a second step Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions are made to estimate the size of the earning disparities. 
73	 Problem/Background: During the last decades, Germany has been experiencing an ongoing religious and cultural diversification.  But despite this process, other groups are still excluded from dominant discourses of the German society. Especially the Muslim population is often presented as being different and oppositional in comparison to the German majority.  Since Islam is of rising interest in the integration debate as a result of the growing Muslim population, it is considered important to find out about these assumed differences.  Purpose: The aim of this thesis is to uncover the ways in which the German majority population differentiates itself from the Muslim population and which pictures of Muslims are reflected in these processes of differentiation.  Brief description of the study’s points of departure and approach: Within this thesis, to analyze the processes of differentiation, the theoretical concepts of the boundary literature are used.  Symbolic boundaries reflect normative distinctions, cultural practices and attitudes or examples of likes and dislikes and reflect the mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion of individuals into a community.  The hypothesis of this thesis is that the processes of exclusion are not independent, but interrelated with the generation one grew up in, with the national identity and with the personal experiences with Islam.  To research these assumptions, a dominant, sequential mixed method design where qualitative methods dominate over quantitative methods is applied.  Survey analysis is used as an insight into possible boundaries and unstructured interviews to uncover the process of boundary drawing in more detail. 
74	Bright and blurred boundaries towards immigrants  In the ALLBUS 2006 respondents were asked how important the following characteristics are, in their opinion, for awarding German citizenship.  The importance was measured on a scale from 1 (= not important) to 7 (= important).   The characteristics that are nearly as important as language are the respect for the constitution (91.5 percent) and not being a criminal (91.4 percent).  To follow the German laws is of great importance and can be explained by the fact that the migrants’ criminality is often criticized in the media.  Then it seems like the constitution patriotism by Habermas (1996) as a base for national identity is highly influential whereas former concepts of national identity in Germany lose in importance.  Another characteristic that is considered as important for the respondents when awarding German citizenship is that one is making his own living (86.9 percent). This can be explained by the spread opinion that immigrants are a threat to the welfare system (Stephan and Stephan, 2000).
75	For my analysis everyone rating the characteristics 5 or higher was categorized as perceiving these characteristic as important for awarding citizenship and was included in the percentage (see Table 3).  Interestingly the concept of an ethnic exclusive society based on Christian values seems to be important for only a few respondents: being a Christian and being of German descent are the least important characteristics for the respondents; the same also applies to the prerequisite “being born in Germany”.  Exclusion processes because of ethnical and religious differences therefore should be less likely, meaning that differences within these categories should not be crucial for the German majority population to socially exclude the “other”.  The most important characteristic is the German language (91.6 percent), therewith leading to the assumption that language constitutes the brightest boundary. 
76	This is not surprising because it is often criticized about the German integration policies that they failed to convey proper language skills. Still nowadays it is not surprising when children of foreigners go their first day to kindergarten or school and speak no or very bad German.
77	When looking at this picture, it seems the boundaries between immigrants and the dominant population can be crossed by such things like proper language skills, the respect of the German laws and by making one’s own living; the concept of an ethnic exclusive society seems to be irrelevant.  But the importance of life style adaptation (80.1 percent consider it as important) pinpoints other obstacles; the importance of adaptation implies that boundaries because of a different lifestyle are rather bright.  This seems to be of great importance when it comes to the inclusion of the Muslim population.   The ALLBUS (2006) asked the respondents, how different they think the lifestyles of Italians/“Aussiedler” (Ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe)/asylum seekers/Turks and Jews are in comparison to their lifestyles.  The lifestyle differences towards Turks are seen as rather high by most respondents (69.5 percent)19, only the group of asylum seekers seems to be more different.  The Turkish Muslim often works as a stereotype for the German Muslim (Kastoryano, 2007) and responses to this question can serve as an indicator for a symbolic exclusion of Muslims. 
78	By analyzing the data from ALLBUS (2006) which gathered information about characteristics considered important for awarding German citizenship, I got a first insight into possible boundaries.   The result was that previous concepts such as being Christian, being of German origin or being born in Germany were losing in importance against much more flexible concepts such as German language skills, respecting the constitution and not being a criminal.  This led to the impression that attitudes towards Muslims must be more open than one would expect when looking at actual public debates. 
79	3.2 Operationalisation The analysis encompass two dependent variables: Church membership is operationalised via a dichotomous variable which assumes a value of 1 if a person belongs to one of the following religious denominations: Protestant (including independent churches), Roman Catholic, other Christian religious community and other non-Christian religious community.  A 0 is coded if a person states that he or she does not belong to any religious community. The frequency of churchgoing is measured via a scale on 6 levels in the ALLBUS (6 = more than once per week, 5 = once per week, 4 = between once and three times per month, 3 = several times per year, 2 = less frequently, 1 = never).  No transformation of these variables into the average annual attendance at religious services was carried out because of the different ranges of most categories. Nor is a categorisation beneficial since this approach causes a loss of information. Continuous variables on the survey year and on the cohort are included in the regression models with fixed effects in order to be able to identify linear and monotone time trends.  In the case of the survey year, the corresponding variable measures how many years have passed since the respective first measurement period (1980 = 0 and 1991 = 0).  The variable concerning birth cohorts can have values from 1 = 1895-1900 to 19 = 1986-1990 (cf. also Tab. 2).  Moreover, cohort classifications are used in the fixed effects models (FE) which are orientated to content aspects that is to prominent historical periods (cf. Tab. 1).  Gender (1 = man, 0 = woman) is included as a further control variable.  It should be stated at the outset that it is shown in all models that women are more religious than men (Collett/Lizardo 2009).  Furthermore, an indicator measuring church membership (1 = yes, 0 = no) is considered in the regression models on churchgoing.  All analyses are carried out separately for Western and Eastern Germany, the East- West classification is based on the current place of residence. 
80	The following paper called Identity beyond the Nation State: The case of the Russian Germans was chosen for various reasons: One reason was to observe if one can speak about the Russian Germans as a group at all.  Secondly, what were their reasons to migrate in case they migrated and what are their motives to migrate.   As a starting point of the research it will be necessary to analyze theoretical concepts and approaches concerning identity and group formation as well as concepts concerning migration.  The main question is how a group forms or constructs its collective identity.   What are the possible reasons why an individual feels themselves as a member of a community?  Therefore in the part – Individual identity – it will be tried to describe individual identity and hereby the concepts of personal and social identity which make following Erik Erikson “a connection between community and individual”.  This is the base for concepts of collective identities. In the part - Collective identities - it will be tried to describe and discuss two different approaches in regards to collective identity: primordialism and constructivism. 
81	Therefore the following questions, which in this analysis will serve as indicators are asked. 1. Concerning influx into Germany: The influx should be possible without limitations, The influx should be possible with limitations, The influx should be prohibited, Do not know 2. Concerning the difference in life style between Germans and ethnic German repatriates: How strongly do ethnic Germans coming from Eastern Europe living in Germany differ from the rest of the German population? Answering options provided range from 1 not at all to 7 very strong.  3. Concerning ethnic German repatriates as neighbors: How pleasant or unpleasant would an ethnic German repatriate be as neighbor for you? Answering options provided range from -3 very unpleasant for me to +3 would be very pleasant for me.  4. Concerning marry-in of an ethnic German repatriate into one’s family How pleasant or unpleasant would a marry-in of a Russian German into your family be for you? Answering options provided range from -3 very unpleasant for me to +3 would be very pleasant for me.  5. Equality under law The ethnic German repatriates living in Germany should have the same rights as Germans in every aspect of their life. Answering options provided range from 1, do not agree at all, to 7, strongly agree. These questions were chosen to observe the acceptance and the perception of ethnic Germans by the domestic population in Germany. 
82	One characteristic of economics is its emphasis on individual choice and its interest in those factors that inﬂuences this choice.  A fundamental element which shapes the way that economists view choices is the idea that individuals choose the action that will have the best consequences in accordance to their preferences. These choices are, in different contexts, at the center of this thesis.  Although the underlying nature of choices is the same in regard to choosing the best alternative, they diﬀer greatly in their characteristics: whether to migrate or to stay (Chapter 2), whether to help or to shirk (Chapter 3) or behave cooperatively or defect (Chapter 4). These choices will be taken in a constantly changing environment.  Beliefs about future developments or the behavior of others are constantly updated and, in turn, actions are adjusted.  Consequently, three terms will be particularly emphasized in this thesis: choices, beliefs and adaptive behavior.  These interconnected terms and their relation are brieﬂy introduced in the following.
83	To measure trust, I use data from the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS). The ALLBUS is a biennially conducted survey on attitudes, behavior and social structure in Germany. Each wave is a nationally representative survey of the population aged 18 and above.  The data used in this paper comes from the 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010 ALLBUS surveys. The standard trust question (”Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you can’t be too careful in dealing with people”) is included in the survey for only a few years. I therefore use the following question: ”Die meisten Leute kümmern sich in Wirklichkeit gar nicht darum, was mit ihren Mitmenschen geschieht” (Most people don’t really care what happens to others) with the answer options ”Bin derselben Meinung” (I agree), ”Bin anderer Meinung” (I disagree), and ”Ich weiß nicht” (I don’t know).  I assume that the respondent's evaluation of the statement reflects her level of generalized trust and refers to it in Section 3.4.  I use the reported trust measure to determine regional averages for all the years available. For the perceived benefit of blood donations, I use the report of accidents in regional daily newspapers. As blood donations are often used for emergency cases, the count of the word ”accidents” is assumed to approximate the demand for blood products as perceived by the population. 
84	This research investigates the mechanisms of change in gender beliefs in East and West Germany since reunification.  Using repeated cross-sectional data from the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS), we examine how processes of cohort replacement and of intra- cohort change contributed to the changes in beliefs about gender ideology and about the consequences of women working for pay that occurred from 1982 to 2004 in the former West Germany and from 1991 to 2004 in the former East Germany.  We find that while changes in gender beliefs occurred through both cohort replacement and within-cohort change in West Germany, changes in East Germany primarily occurred through processes of intra-cohort change.  Heterogeneity in levels of schooling and employment status are important in accounting for variation in gender beliefs.  We find support for the conclusion that there are continued changes in gender beliefs in the reunified Germany across time. However, we do not find that beliefs converged in the East and West following reunification.
85	 Gender beliefs are conceptualized as ‘cognitive representations of ‘‘what is’’ ’ the appropriate gendered division of labour in the family (Alwin, 2005). 
86	 The English translations of these questions are given in Table 1.   Agreement with the belief that there are benefits derived from women’s employment outside the home and that women should engage in market activities indicates egalitarian gender beliefs.   Although gender beliefs could also be conceptualized as encompassing, for example, women’s legal rights or issues of biological differences between the sexes, in this research, we concentrate on gender beliefs pertaining to women and men’s roles in the family and market. 
87	Over this 22 year period spanning (for the FRG) from before reunification, 1982, to 15 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, 2004, there is a clear pattern of increasing acceptance of an extra familial role for women.   Overall, the belief that women working for pay are able to establish warm relationships with their children (FECHLD) and the belief that it is not necessarily the case that women should help their husbands with their careers instead of trying to get ahead themselves (FEHELP) garnered the most support.  The lowest levels of egalitarian support surrounded the belief that a child is likely to ‘suffer’ if his or her mother works for pay (FEPRESCH).  Men in the West show particular concern regarding this consequence of women working with only 30 per cent of men in the West in 2004 disagreeing with the belief that a child is likely to ‘suffer.’  While men and women in both the East and West expressed the most concern regarding this particular consequence of women working, still 77 per cent of East German women gave an egalitarian response to this question (FEPRESCH) in 2004.  Clearly, the state socialist provision of child care and preschool for children virtually removed the belief that women’s working outside the home would harm their children. 
88	 The major economic story of the last decade has been the surge and collapse of house prices worldwide.  Yet political economists have had little to say about how this critical phenomenon affects citizens’ welfare and their demands from government.  This article develops a novel theoretical argument linking housing prices to social policy preferences and policy outcomes.  I argue that homeowners, particularly those experiencing rapid house price appreciation, will become less supportive of social insurance policies since their houses act as a form of self-supplied private insurance against job and income loss.   Political parties that represent homeowners will, following these preferences, cut social insurance spending substantially during housing booms.   This is particularly apparent in those countries that saw large capital inflows accompanying their housing booms.  I test these propositions using both micro-data on social preferences from surveys in the USA, UK, and Germany, and macro-data of national social spending for 18 countries between 1975 and 2001. 
89	 I use three questions on social policy preferences as dependent variables.  These questions do not match precisely those used in the previous two samples but there is some overlap.  The first question asks whether “social benefits” should be cut or extended, referring to general social insurance policies.   The second question asks whether the government should “secure the income” of all citizens in times of hardship.  This question is related to social insurance motivations, albeit more to unemployment insurance than to pensions.  Finally, the third question asks whether social differences are just.  There is some correspondence here to the redistribution question in the BSAS, though here respondents are not asked whether the government should reduce the gap between rich and poor, simply whether that gap is fair.   The three questions are available for different years in the ALLBUS survey: the social benefits question for 1994, 2000, and 2004; the income security question for 1991, 1994, 2000, and 2004; and the social differences question for 1988, 1991, 1994, 1998, 2000, and 2004.  Thus, the latter questions reflect greater variation in house price changes than does the former.

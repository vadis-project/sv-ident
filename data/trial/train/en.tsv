BWPUJK-V3KH4D	Second, time conditions winners’ democratic sentiments, but in discrepant ways in the east and west of the country. 	0	No
PSNEOK	Bright and blurred boundaries towards immigrants 	0	No

VINJRA	This question is related to social insurance motivations, albeit more to unemployment insurance than to pensions. 	0	No
ASHRDV-6Z6XJI	Theoretical work based on social identity theory and in-group favoritism predicts that increased population diversity (e.g., due to immigration) reduces support for redistributive public policies.	0	No
QUVGTX	Therefore the following questions, which in this analysis will serve as indicators are asked.	0	No
HI7F0M-ZUEUAM	A dichotomous variable was created in which respondents who selected law and order as the most-important political goal were coded as 1, and all other responses were coded as 0. 	0	No
HVIJGN	“Everybody should get the money he needs - regardless of any performance.” 	1	204-Yes,207-No,210-No,213-No
ELCYXP	The ALLBUS asks respondents to evaluate these and other life aspects and job attributes on a 7-point Likert-type scale, where a higher value corresponds with higher importance.	0	No
PSNEOK	This led to the impression that attitudes towards Muslims must be more open than one would expect when looking at actual public debates. 	0	No
ASHRDV-6Z6XJI	This is important because – even though this generally remains untested in previous work – the Alesina et al. (1999) and Alesina and La Ferrara (2000) framework argues that lower preferences for redistribution in heterogeneous communities are driven by individuals feeling a higher degree of altruism towards those with whom they share a common ‘identity.’	0	No
VINJRA	 The major economic story of the last decade has been the surge and collapse of house prices worldwide. 	0	No
ELCYXP	A probit regression using these life aspects as independent variables conﬁrms that a higher ceteris paribus evaluation of the importance of work in our sample corresponds with a higher probability of being employed. 	0	No

E64WCO=BGJUWD	To value whether these lower levels of prejudice are a function of education or the constitution of the social environment, Model 3 includes the percentage of foreigners, local intergroup relationships, attitudes toward ethnic diversity, and lifestyle differences in the analysis. 	0	No
9V7EL1-HBAZKR	According to the ﬁrst view, people’s expectations about the future should have weak or null inﬂuence on people’s current well-being.	0	No

HVIJGN	“Rank differences are performance based and therefore acceptable.” 	1	206-Yes,205-No,207-No,183-No
ASHRDV-6Z6XJI	Figure II clearly illustrates that there was no significant difference in the strength of identification of Catholics and Protestants in Bavaria in 1991 (though with Catholics feeling slightly more attached on average), but that Catholics were signiﬁcantly less likely to strongly identify with their communities in 2008, after the reuniﬁcation migration wave (statistically signiﬁcant at 10 percent). 	1	732-Yes,734-No
PSNEOK	But the importance of life style adaptation (80.1 percent consider it as important) pinpoints other obstacles; the importance of adaptation implies that boundaries because of a different lifestyle are rather bright. 	1	265-Yes,287-No,288-No
AIBQWT	The focus is on attitudes, behavior and social structure. It is conducted through face-to-face interviews. The survey emphasis varies between years. 	0	No
ASHRDV-6Z6XJI	Interestingly, West German Catholics outside of Bavaria – who were less strongly subjected to non-Catholic immigration after reuniﬁcation – show the opposite pattern (with a weakly stronger local attachment after reuniﬁcation).	0	No
BUZSLK	Response sets are used to develop formal indicators, and content of responses is used to develop content-related indicators. During the analysis, numerous formal indicators are tested and compared with content-related indicators. The results indicate that the majority of formal indicators allow for differentiation between real and false data, and, in addition, certain content-related indicators are useful for such differentiation. 	0	No
AANYKC	Social capital is often defined as consisting of trust and post materialist values on the one hand, and social networks on the other. 	0	No
AANYKC	Since the cross regional correlations among the three surveys with regard to political interest are high, only the FORSA data is included here. 	0	No

AANYKC	 Six additional proxies were selected for the hierarchy preferences. 	0	No
HQZXQL-WL0CJ4	Bauernschuster et al. (2012) show that the answers to these questions reflect norms shaped under socialism that are unfavorable of entrepreneurship. 	0	No
E64WCO=BGJUWD	Foreigners should not be allowed to engage in political activities 	1	272-Yes,273-No
HI7F0M-ZUEUAM	Yet, little is known as to how punitive attitudes and their sources vary internationally.	0	No

AANYKC	The indicator is highly correlated with the regional attitudes to the German left-wing party PDS and the right-wing party REP also available in the FORSA database. 	0	NoSkip
E64WCO=BGJUWD	In terms of contacts with foreigners, one can see that the theoretically assumed greater contact opportunities in major cities of over 500,000 inhabitants result in higher intergroup contacts. 	0	No
PSNEOK	To follow the German laws is of great importance and can be explained by the fact that the migrants’ criminality is often criticized in the media. 	0	No
AANYKC	To avoid bias with regard to national manifestations mostly taking place in the capital or other central cities, we concentrated on local and regional manifestations per 1000 inhabitants in the period 1980-1993. 	0	No
HI7F0M-ZUEUAM	Here, three measures are included to assess the effects of these attitudes on citizens’ punitive beliefs. 	0	No

TEEEJW	Consequently, three terms will be particularly emphasized in this thesis: choices, beliefs and adaptive behavior. 	0	No
HI7F0M-ZUEUAM	Victimization and fear of crime are dichotomous, with “1” indicating positive responses to either of the two following questions: “Have you been a victim of theft in the past 3 years?” and “Is there any place in the immediate vicinity in which you fear walking alone at night?” 	1	689-Yes,724-Yes,690-No,723-No
4E1K1A-VQOXIJ	Building upon work begun in a seminar at the Religion Department of Tübingen University, the authors intend to check the observations made at the international level by Norris and Inglehart against inner-societal data for Germany and, if the postulated connection should be confirmed, to explain it with a theory based upon the material data and supported by Religious and Demographic Studies.	0	No
BUZSLK	For example, in the case of rounding as an indicator, questions about income varied between the two studies. 	0	No
HI7F0M-ZUEUAM	This item was reverse coded so that higher values indicate increased feelings of life fulfillment or satisfaction. 	0	No
E64WCO=BGJUWD	Third, in terms of spatial context effects, the switch between majority and minority group positions in residential areas appears to be a tipping point for prejudice, which means that even people with low levels of prejudice wish to live as the ethnic majority in their respective residential area. 	0	No
HI7F0M-ZUEUAM	Using Germany as a case study, this article expands the scope of punitiveness research by examining how factors typically examined in American studies, such as cynicism, institutional trust, law and order culture, and antiminority attitudes, relate to citizen beliefs about punishment in a different cultural context.	0	No
VINJRA	Thus, the latter questions reflect greater variation in house price changes than does the former. 	0	No
IGWRXA	Research presented here uses the GGSS measures for domain-specific national pride and general national pride.	0	No
EMNGSA	On the other hand, recent studies on polarization of mass opinion in the UK ( Adams, Green and Milazzo, 2012a,b)or the Netherlands (Adams, Vries and Leiter, 2011) have reported trends of depolarization rather than polarization as well. 	0	No
HQZXQL-WL0CJ4	Robustness tests include matching and student fixed effects confirm the validity of our results. 	0	No
PSNEOK	Exclusion processes because of ethnical and religious differences therefore should be less likely, meaning that differences within these categories should not be crucial for the German majority population to socially exclude the “other”. 	0	No

PSNEOK	Since Islam is of rising interest in the integration debate as a result of the growing Muslim population, it is considered important to find out about these assumed differences. 	0	No
TEEEJW	These choices will be taken in a constantly changing environment. 	0	No
E64WCO=BGJUWD	Intergroup contacts at work, in the neighborhood, and in the family do not appear to have any influence in Model 4. 	1	274-Yes,275-Yes,276-Yes,251-No,253-No,271-No
BYRP9N-DETZU	Rather, the increase seems to be triggered by macro-structural changes in the country of origin.	0	No
DAMECL	" Comparing the responses of the users of a community currency to those of the general population (data Euro barometer 72.4, survey 2009) there is a clear difference: 89% of users of a community currency evaluate the statement ""less emphasis on money and material possessions“ as a good thing, whereas just 61% of the general population share this opinion."	0	No
EMNGSA	“Differences in social standing between people are acceptable because they basically reflect what people made out of the opportunities they had.” 	1	206-Yes,205-No,207-No,183-No
IGWRXA	While Mussolini and Hitler demonstrated early how symbolic benefits can be reaped from international sport events, the so-called “politicization” of international sports, that is, the use of sport as a vehicle for identity politics, has heavily intensified after World War II (Tomlinson and Young, 2006). 	0	No

HI7F0M-ZUEUAM	Prior studies have found that those who are cynical about the moral and social relationships among society members will be more likely to be punitive, because they are less likely to believe that criminals can be rehabilitated, and because citizens believe that softer approaches to punishing offenders is unlikely to restore social order or improve moral and value standards (Tyler Boeckmann, 1997; Unnever Cullen, 2010).	0	No
TEEEJW	These interconnected terms and their relation are brieﬂy introduced in the following.	0	No
PWSJEX	The analysis encompass two dependent variables: Church membership is operationalised via a dichotomous variable which assumes a value of 1 if a person belongs to one of the following religious denominations: Protestant (including independent churches), Roman Catholic, other Christian religious community and other non-Christian religious community. 	1	732-Yes,734-No,735-No

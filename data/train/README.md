## Data

> **Warning**
> This repository currently only contains half of the training data. We will release the full data soon! Stay tuned!

This folder currently contains training data. In total, it contains 1980 sentences. The files contain the following columns:

```
sentence:       Textual instance, which may contain a variable mention.
is_variable:    Label, whether the textual instance contains a variable mention (1) or not (0). This column can be used for Task 1 (Variable Detection).
variable:       Variables (separated by a comma ";") that are mentioned in the textual instance. This column can be used for Task 2 (Variable Disambiguation).
research_data:  Research data IDs (separated by a ";") that are relevant for each instance (and in general for each "doc_id").
doc_id:         ID of the source document. Each document is written in one language (either English or German).
uuid:           Unique ID of the instance in uuid4 format.
```

The language for each document can be found in the document-language mapping file [here](https://github.com/vadis-project/sv-ident/blob/main/data/train/document_languages.json), which maps `doc_id` to a language code (`en`, `de`). The variables metadata (i.e., the vocabulary) can be downloaded from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18slgACOcE8-_xIDX09GrdpFSqRRcBiON/view?usp=sharing). We recommend downloading it into this directory (`/sv-ident/data/train/`). The metadata file has the following format:

```
{
  "research_data_id": {
    "variable_id": VARIABLE_METADATA,
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

Each variable may contain all (or some) of the following values:
```
study_title:        The title of the research data study.
variable_label:     The label of the variable.
variable_name:      The name of the variable.
question_text:      The question of the variable in the original language.
question_text_en:   The question of the variable in English.
sub_question:       The sub-question of the variable.
item_categories:    The item categories of the variable.
answer_categories:  The answers of the variable.
topic:              The topics of the variable in the original language.
topic_en:           The topics of the variable in English.
```
